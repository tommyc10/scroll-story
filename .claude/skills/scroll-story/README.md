# scroll-story for Claude Code and Codex

Builds scroll-driven product stories: a pinned, cinematic page where scrolling plays (and
rewinds) a film of a product's workflow, with camera moves that "scroll into" each step. It's
based on three primary versions: **Fly** (`assets/fly/`, the default 3D film),
**Midnight** (`assets/midnight/`, the original detailed walkthrough), and **Carousel**
(`assets/carousel/`, linked service screens on a 3D turntable).

## Use it

In Claude Code:

```text
/scroll-story use Fly for our onboarding flow, following one user from sign-up to first invoice
/scroll-story use Midnight for a detailed walkthrough of our approval flow
/scroll-story use Carousel to follow one order through our connected services
```

In Codex:

```text
$scroll-story use Fly for our onboarding flow
$scroll-story use Midnight for our approval flow
$scroll-story use Carousel to show how our services hand off one customer order
```

Say which repo is the product and which repo the story should be saved in:

```text
/scroll-story use Fly for the checkout flow in ../acme-web, save the story in ../my-stories
```

The product repo is read-only: the agent reads how it works, its styles, components and
wording, and changes nothing there. The story is built as a standalone app in the repo you
name, in `stories/<product-name>/`. If you don't name one, the agent uses a folder in the
workspace that is clearly for stories (it already has a `stories/` folder, or it's the repo
that holds this skill), or asks. It never defaults to the product repo.

Both agents can also select the skill for a relevant product-story request. The skill routes
from the chosen version to its working source, then covers storyboarding, adaptation and
verification. Zoom remains an optional alternative when specifically wanted.

## Install

The skill works from anywhere; where it's installed doesn't decide where stories go.

- **In a stories repo**: clone the scroll-story repository (rename it if you like, e.g.
  `my-stories`). The skill lives at `.claude/skills/scroll-story/` (Claude Code) and
  `.agents/skills/scroll-story` is a relative symlink to it (Codex). Stories go in its
  `stories/` folder by default.
- **In another skills folder**: copy this folder to wherever your agent reads skills, such as
  `.github/skills/scroll-story`, and name the stories repo in your request.
- **Globally**: copy this folder to `~/.claude/skills/scroll-story` and link
  `~/.codex/skills/scroll-story` to it. Name the stories repo in your request.

Open the product repo and the stories repo in the same VS Code workspace, and give the agent
access to both if needed: `/add-dir <path>` in Claude Code, `codex --add-dir <path>` in Codex.

The full Fly, Midnight and Carousel reference applications are bundled in `assets/fly/`,
`assets/midnight/` and `assets/carousel/`. Copying this skill folder includes everything
needed except installed package dependencies. See `references/builds.md` for setup and
`references/carousel.md` for the turntable geometry and hand-off choreography.
