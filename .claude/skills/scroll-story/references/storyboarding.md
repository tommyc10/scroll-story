# Storyboarding a scroll story

The storyboard decides whether the page is memorable. Get it right before writing code.

## 1. Pick the protagonist

Choose **one concrete object** the viewer can follow from start to finish. Not "alerts", but
*INC-40231, tractor beam coupling 7, 06:00*. Not "orders", but *order #1182, two lamps, shipping
to Leeds*. Give it an ID, a time, a specific detail or two. A named, specific thing makes every
later abstraction ("214 like it", "a rule that matches it") land as a consequence.

Good protagonists already exist in the product's mock data. Use them.

## 2. Find the arc

Most B2B workflow products fit this arc (Midnight's, with the chapter it became):

| Beat | Midnight | Generic form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The noise | A wall of live alerts | The status quo, overwhelming |
| The one | One alert, auto-clears in 74 s | Zoom in on one instance of the problem |
| It's not one | 214 like it, every shift change | Reveal it's a pattern (a count, a chart) |
| The insight | The engine extracts conditions | The product notices / does the clever bit |
| The artefact | A proposed rule with evidence | The product's core object, in its real UI |
| The human | A person approves, with a reason | Control, trust, the decision moment |
| The effect | Alerts stream through a gate | The product working at scale |
| The edge case | A 41% rule with a real attack in it | A guardrail: what it *won't* let you do |
| The record | The audit log | Accountability, history, proof |
| The quiet | The same wall, now quiet | Bookend: the opening, transformed |

You don't need every beat. A consumer app might be *the moment → the magic → the result*.
But **open and close on the same image**, changed. That bookend is what makes it feel finished.

## 3. Plan the carry-overs

For every chapter boundary, decide what physically travels. This is the single most important
column in the storyboard, because it's what makes it a film rather than a slideshow.

| From → to | Carry-over used in Midnight |
| --- | --- |
| Opening → ticket | The camera dives ×9 into one row of the wall; the ticket grows up behind it |
| Ticket → recurrence | The ticket card shrinks into one square of a weekly unit chart |
| Recurrence → pattern | All 214 squares pour into a stack of cards |
| Pattern → rule | The query flies into its place on the rule page, which builds around it |
| Rule → decision | Same scene; the camera leans in on the approval form |
| Decision → gate | The whole rule page folds down into a small "rule" chip on a gate |
| Gate → guardrail | A new proposal notification arrives; the camera dives into it |
| Guardrail → audit | The page steps back; the log fills oldest-first |
| Audit → ending | The wall returns, quiet |

## 4. Write the storyboard table

Show the user this table before building:

```
| # | Chapter | Caption title | On screen | What the scroll does | Carries into next |
|---|---------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| – | Opening | (headline)    | …         | …                    | camera dives into … |
| 1 | …       | …             | …         | …                    | … |
```

## 5. Captions

Each chapter has a caption on the left: a small meta line ("02 — Recurrence"), a title, a body,
and optionally an aside. Rules of thumb from Midnight:

- **Title: under ~8 words, a complete thought.** "It starts with a ticket." "A person signs
  for it." "Not everything that repeats is noise."
- **Body: 2–3 sentences, concrete.** Numbers, times, names. "214 times in 90 days, always at
  shift change, and 98% gone before anyone looked."
- **Captions explain; the scene shows.** Don't caption what's visible. Say why it matters.
- **One joke, late.** Midnight's aside, under the guardrail chapter: "Someone should have told
  the Death Star." It lands because everything before it was straight.

## 6. Pacing

- 1 timeline second ≈ 0.24 window heights of scrolling (`SCROLL_PER_SECOND` in `Film.tsx`).
  Midnight is ~64 s ≈ 15 screens. Under ~40 s feels thin; over ~80 s starts to drag.
- A chapter is typically 4–7 s: ~1–1.5 s of transition in, the action, then a **hold of
  ~1 s** at the end so the viewer can read the caption before the next transition starts.
- Busy chapters (a stream, a form being filled) can run 10–14 s. Split them if they go longer.
- Captions come in *after* the camera settles (~0.5–1 s into the chapter) and leave as the
  next transition starts.

## 7. Mining the product

Read the product's code in the product repo (read-only; not the skill's reference builds).

**First, how it works:**
- **Purpose**: README, docs, any product or marketing copy. Who is it for, and what problem
  does it solve?
- **Flows**: pages, routes and navigation. What can a user do, and in what order? Trace the
  main flow from its first screen to its result.
- **Model**: types, schemas, database models. What are the core objects and how do they
  relate? These are your protagonist candidates.
- **Rules**: statuses, state machines, validations, permissions, business logic in services
  and API handlers. These are the story's turning points (what makes something "approved",
  what's blocked, what needs a person).
- **Evidence**: tests, fixtures and seed data show real cases and edge cases, often better
  than the UI does.

**Then, how it looks and talks:**
- **Tokens**: copy its theme variables into `styles/tokens.css`. Match its easing tokens.
- **Components**: rebuild the key ones at stage size (a card, a badge, the main detail page).
  Don't import the real components; they bring layout and state you don't want. Copy the
  CSS values so it looks identical.
- **Data**: use its mock data, fixtures or seed data: names, IDs and numbers. In-jokes in the
  data (Midnight's Star Wars world) are gold for a story. If there's none, write realistic
  examples that fit its types and rules. Never copy real customer data, personal details or
  secrets from the repo, and mark any numbers you invent so the user can confirm or replace them.
