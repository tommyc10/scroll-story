# Verifying a scroll story

Scroll films break in three places: **mid-transition**, **on the way back up**, and **on
load**. Check all three, plus the fallback and the build. The scripts are in `scripts/`; they
need Playwright:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/story-check && cd /tmp/story-check && npm init -y >/dev/null && npm i playwright
npx playwright install chromium      # first time only
cp <skill>/scripts/*.mjs .
```

Keep the Playwright scratch folder outside both repos, as above, so neither the skill, the story
nor the product gets extra dependencies. Run `npm run build` in the story folder.

**If Playwright can't run, don't loop.** On locked-down machines (devpods, CI images, no
internet) the Chromium download or launch can fail. Try once; on Linux, a launch error about
missing libraries needs `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`, which needs sudo. If
that isn't possible, skip sections 1–5, still run section 6, and tell the user which checks
were skipped so they can scroll the story themselves.

They rely on `window.__film` (set by `Film.tsx` in dev). Start or reuse the story folder's
dev server (`npm run dev`, in the background). Set `STORY_URL` to the actual URL
printed by that server, including any app path or direction query. Both scripts accept
`--url` or the `STORY_URL` environment variable; neither assumes a port.

## 1. Settled frames: does each chapter land?

```bash
node shoot.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --out ./shots
```
Shoots the start, each chapter just before it ends (settled), and the end. **Look at every
image.** Check: captions don't overlap scene content; nothing is clipped by the stage edge or
the top bar; counters show final values; the badge has flipped.

## 2. Mid-transition frames: do the moves look intentional?

```bash
node shoot.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --times 2.2,7.9,12.7,20.9 --out ./shots      # pick times inside transitions
node shoot.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --every 0.5 --out ./frames                    # or a flipbook of the whole film
```
Check the camera dive at its midpoint, each fly-to halfway, the fold, the pour. Common finds:
a translucent chip showing doubled text, a card scaling from the wrong origin, a layer that
should have been hidden still painting behind.

## 3. Rewind: does scrolling back restore everything?

```bash
node shoot.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --rewind --times 34,14.5,5,0.2 --out ./shots
```
Jumps to the end first, then back. Compare with the forward shots at the same times: counters
back at their mid values, pills back in the lane, typed text shorter, scrambled values specific
again, the opening state restored (for example the wall back to "live").

## 4. Load: no flash on reload

```bash
node check-load.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --reloads 5
```
Reloads with fonts slowed and fails if the stage is ever visible before the film marks itself
`data-ready`. Scenes are drawn finished, so an early stage shows every scene at once.

## 5. Fallbacks

```bash
node shoot.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --mobile --out ./shots     # 390px: expect the storyboard, full page
node shoot.mjs --url "$STORY_URL" --reduced --out ./shots    # reduced motion at desktop size: also the storyboard
```
Check each still is cropped to its scene and readable, and each caption sits above its still.

## 6. Build and console

```bash
npm run build            # tsc + vite: must pass
```
Every script prints console errors and warnings, and exits non-zero if there are any.

## What the scripts can't tell you

Feel. Pacing, whether a pause is long enough to read a caption, whether a transition is too
fast on a trackpad. Scroll it yourself with a trackpad *and* a mouse wheel, ideally the next day.
Say so when handing over, rather than claiming it "feels right".
