# Directions: different ways to move through the same product

A direction is a **motion grammar**: how the scroll behaves, how the camera moves, and how one
scene hands over to the next. It is **not** a new visual style. Keep the product's own look
(its tokens, type, cards, badges, buttons): the story sells the real UI. What makes two
stories feel different is how you travel through them.

The primary choices are **Fly** (`assets/fly/`, Fly opens by default) and **Midnight**
(`assets/midnight/`, the original walkthrough). See `builds.md` for source locations.
Zoom and Snap remain optional variations in `assets/fly/` (`?d=zoom | snap | fly`).

## 1. What changes and what doesn't

**Stays the same**: the product's visual language · pinned + scrubbed by one timeline ·
scenes drawn in their end state · exact rewind · a caption per chapter · the chapter rail ·
the load gate · the fallback · every transition carries something.

**Changes**: whether the scroll is smooth or snaps · the camera (none, 2D zoom, 3D) · the
transition moves · where captions sit (left column, glass panel) · small chrome (a zoom or
depth readout).

## 2. Choosing

| If the story is about… | Direction | Grammar in one line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Going from the whole system down to one record and back | **Zoom** | Scroll *into* the UI, again and again, with portal zooms |
| A launch / keynote pace, one idea per beat | **Snap** | Each flick plays one move; the layout does the travelling |
| Scale, systems, flow | **Fly** | A 3D camera flies through floating UI |
| A calm walkthrough of the product | **Midnight** | The starter / `assets/midnight/`: fly-tos, one dive |
| How independent services hand work to each other | **Carousel** | Standing service screens on a 3D turntable; a turn carries each output to the next |

Choose Fly, Midnight or Carousel from the brief unless the user requests another direction. Honour an
explicit choice and name it in the storyboard table. Zoom and Snap are optional alternatives.

## 3. Zoom

- **World**: a board of the product's own cards (in Midnight, one card per assignment group,
  open alerts as amber dots). Every deeper screen is also drawn as a **miniature** in the one
  above it, so every zoom is a portal zoom (§7).
- **Beats**: zoom into the group card · into one dot, which is the alert's page · zoom back out
  as the dots pour into a weekly chart (dots tween position, radius and colour into squares) ·
  pan to the engine, leader lines draw from annotations into the rule's conditions · zoom into
  the rule page; type the reason, press Approve, badge → Active · zoom all the way out: the rule
  lands on the board as a card, its group turns green and its dots go hollow; one red dot stays.
- **Details**: dim everything but the target before each dive (fly *to* something, not through
  a crowd) · the inner layer's background fades in only on landing (`backdrop`) so the board
  shows around it mid-zoom · captions in a glass panel that comes and goes with each caption ·
  a zoom readout from `onZoom`.

## 4. Snap

- **Scroll**: snaps to each chapter's resting frame (§8). One flick = one move played through.
- **Beats**: scroll *through the counter of the "o"* in the headline (portal with `prime` so
  the next page shows through the hole, `beyond` + a growing `clip-path: ellipse()` from
  `onZoom` so the hole swallows the screen; release the clip once through) · the page is 12
  **slats** that gather into the bar chart while the alert card squashes onto this week's bar ·
  the next page **slides in** as the old one drifts slower (parallax) · an **iris** opens out of
  the Approve button · **bands** wipe the next page in · alerts ride a lane to a gate; matches
  are struck through and **drop** (power2.in) · the ending irises out of the one that got
  through; the headline returns with "noise" struck out.
- **Details**: fit the letter's window to its actual counter (screenshot mid-dive and
  adjust) · space conveyor items so a dropped one is gone before the next arrives ·
  `?nosnap` for testing, or screenshots snap to the nearest rest.

## 5. Fly

- **World**: one CSS 3D scene (`perspective: 1200px`): the product's cards floating at
  different depths, alerts as faint points of light, a wall of chart tiles, a floor with a gate.
- **Orbit camera**: target (tx, ty, tz), distance d, tilt rx, turn ry; the world gets
  `translate3d(fx, fy, P − d) rotateX(rx) rotateY(ry) translate3d(−tx, −ty, −tz)`, redrawn from
  one tweened `cam` object. At d = perspective, things at the target are true size.
- **Beats**: dolly to the alert · pull back and orbit; the card shrinks through space onto its
  tile; the rest arrive from z −900 · swing to the front; condition chips fly out of the wall into
  the rule and settle from amber to the rule's colours · a reticle locks on Approve; the approval
  panel comes forward in z while the rule softens (rack focus); a light sweep flips it Active ·
  crane up and tilt 56° onto the floor; spheres roll through a ring gate, matches sink, one rolls
  on and raises a red beacon · pull far back for the ending.
- **3D rules** (break them and it silently flattens): `preserve-3d` on every level from the
  world to a moving object; no opacity < 1, filter, `overflow` or `backdrop-filter` on those
  levels (fade leaf panels, hide objects with visibility); nothing on the camera's path;
  standing objects lean back to face a tilted camera. Fade the hero **layer**, not just its
  text, or its scrim darkens the whole scene.

## 6. Midnight

The starter and `assets/midnight/`: a fixed stage of product screens, fly-tos between them,
one camera dive at the start, a pointer acting out clicks. Calm and product-first.

## 7. The portal zoom

`src/lib/camera.ts` in the starter.

```ts
portal(s, {
  outer: groupLayer,          // the scene you're in (a full-stage layer)
  inner: alertLayer,          // the scene you're going into (a full-stage layer)
  target: ME_CARD,            // where the inner sits, as a miniature, on the outer (stage aspect)
  at: t + 0.1, duration: 1.9,
  direction: 'in',            // 'out' plays it backwards: the inner shrinks back into target
  fade: [0.3, 0.55],          // z range where the inner fades in over its miniature
  backdrop: innerBg,          // optional: inner background fades in only on landing
  beyond: 2.6,                // optional: keep diving after landing (through a hole)
  prime: true,                // optional: pose both layers now (a glimpse before the zoom)
  onZoom: (z, scale) => {},   // optional: readouts, clip-paths
});
```

- The miniature is the same component at `scale(target.w / 1440)`, so the crossfade is between
  two copies of the same markup. If the miniature's state changes (before/after), stack two
  phases and swap them while the full-size layer covers the screen.
- Log-scale (`s = k^z`) about the fixed point `k·o/(k − 1)`; a linear scale tween rushes the
  start and crawls at the end.
- Only the portal moves the two layers (it writes their transform every frame); animate
  children for everything else.

## 8. Snap to beats

In `Film.tsx`'s ScrollTrigger:

```ts
const rests = [0, ...marks.map((m) => (m.end - 0.25) / tl.duration()), 1];
snap: {
  snapTo: (v, self) => ScrollTrigger.snapDirectional(rests)(v, self?.direction ?? 1),
  duration: { min: 0.8, max: 2.4 }, delay: 0.08, ease: 'power1.inOut',
},
```

Directional, so a small flick forward always moves on a beat (never snaps back). Turn it off
with a query flag for testing.

## 9. Inventing more

Other grammars that keep the product's look: a **horizontal track** (vertical scroll drives a
sideways film strip of screens); a **stack** (screens pile up like cards, each new one sliding
over the last); a **scan** (a line sweeps the product and everything it passes updates); a
**split** (text scrolls normally on the left while one pinned product panel morphs on the
right). The test: can you say the grammar in one sentence, and does every chapter boundary
carry something?

## 10. Carousel

Use `assets/carousel/` and read `carousel.md`. The camera starts above a ring of standing
service screens, descends to the active one, pulls back and tilts slightly as the table turns,
then settles on the receiver. Colored payload chips sit between producer and receiver; the
floor link lights in the producer's color and stays lit. For a verified loop, the final
hand-off returns to and changes the first service before the camera rises to show the whole
ring. The bundled app opens directly in this direction.
